        <h1> <u> MY STORY: </u> </h1>
        
        <P> When I was 14, whenever I saw code, my eyes would shine with excitement and curiosity. 
            I knew then that there was something magical about the world of programming.
            Over the years, my passion for coding grew stronger, and I dedicated myself to learning and improving my skills. </P> 

        <p> <i> Completing the first part of a 1.5-year journey at "GIAIC" was no small feat. It required dedication, hard work, and resilience. 
            Along the way, I faced numerous challenges, but each one taught me valuable lessons and strengthened my resolve </i> </P>

        <P> <b> Now, as I look forward to the next chapter of my life, I am more committed than ever to becoming a dedicated developer.
             My journey is just beginning, and I am excited to embrace every opportunity to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact through my work.
             With the knowledge and skills I've gained, I am confident that I can overcome any challenges and achieve my dreams. </b> </P>

             <p> The road to success is never easy, but with perseverance and passion,
